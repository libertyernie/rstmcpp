rstmcpp
=======

An experimental port of BrawlLib's RSTM encoder, and the WAV file 
handling from LoopingAudioConverter, to C++.

Should compile and run in Visual Studio 2015 and g++ 5.3.0.

Uses the DSP encoder from https://github.com/jackoalan/gc-dspadpcm-encode,
which was (at least partially) based on the one in BrawlLib.
